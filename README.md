# Neuronal brain region-specific DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility are associated with neuropsychiatric trait heritability

Scripts used for analysis of data in paper, 'Neuronal brain region-specific DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility are associated with neuropsychiatric trait heritability'. A preprint is availble on bioRxiv ([https://doi.org/10.1101/120386](https://doi.org/10.1101/120386), and the paper is in press. The code in this repository reflects the final submitted version, which is substantially different from the version on bioRxiv.

This is a complicated project and reproducing all of the results presented, especially from raw data, is highly non-trivial.

The version of this Github repository submitted with the paper has the following DOI on Zenodo  
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.1469577.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1469577)

To be clear, the code in this repository was not written with the intention of it being an example of clean, reproducible analyses documenting the figures reported in the paper.
Consequently, the code in this repository is warts-and-all: it includes code underlying published figures but also dead-end analyses and abandoned ideas.
~~Abandon hope~~ Fair warning to all ye who enter here.

We opt to share the code in this repository with the view that opening up the code underyling our analyses, in all its ugly glory, is better than it being hidden away.
